          public_name: Public name for public virtual IP
          public_name_hint:
            The public name is the hostname that will be used instead of the
            generated public name for the public virtual IP of HAProxy (when
            registering public endpoints, for instance). Any name specified
            here should already exist in the upstream DNS zones.
        setup_hb_gui: Setup non-web GUI (hb_gui)
        hb_gui_hint:
          If this is changed to true after cluster startup, each node in
          the cluster requires the Pacemaker service to be restarted in order
          to make the GUI accessible.
