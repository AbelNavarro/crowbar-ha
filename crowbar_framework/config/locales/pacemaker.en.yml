        haproxy:
          ssl_info:
            'The hostname for each virtual IP of HAProxy is generated by
            prefixing the name of the network to "%{vhostname}". For instance,
            the hostname of the admin virtual IP will be "admin.%{vhostname}".
            If using SSL for services that will be served behind HAProxy, then
            the SSL certificates will have to be valid for the hostname of the
            virtual IP for each network being used (in general, admin and
            public), and for the public name if defined.'
          public_name: Public name for public virtual IP
          public_name_hint:
            The public name is the hostname that will be used instead of the
            generated public name for the public virtual IP of HAProxy (when
            registering public endpoints, for instance). Any name specified
            here should already exist in the upstream DNS zones.
        gui_header: Pacemaker GUI
        setup_hb_gui: Setup non-web GUI (hb_gui)
        hb_gui_hint:
          If this is changed to true after cluster startup, each node in
          the cluster requires the Pacemaker service to be restarted in order
          to make the GUI accessible.

            hypervisor_ip: IP address of hypervisor
            hypervisor_ip_hint: Note that libvirt on your host needs to be configured to listen on TCP, with no TLS and no authentication. The firewall should also be configured to allow communication from the virtual machines.
